How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Got to know the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    could get to know the mistakes done before and can correct 
    them in later versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: have full control when to commit.can commit when required.

    cons: sometimes it becomes difficult to decide when to commit as compared
    to other version control systems  where the changes are automatically
    saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    beacuse multiple files may be dependent on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: to view different commits done at different point of time.

    git diff: to compare different versions of same file or a repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can change my code without the fear that if the new changes breaks
    something i can anytime return to my previous code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
